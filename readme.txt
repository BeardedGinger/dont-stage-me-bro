Let your team (or future self) know whether or not it's cool to overwrite an existing staging site on WP Engine

== Description ==

Works with the staging feature on WP Engine and displays a controllable notice letting others know whether or not it is okay to overwrite the existing staging site.

Do you use a different hosting provider that has a similar staging site feature? Contact us and we'd be happy to look into integrating it here.

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for ‘genesis shortcode generator’
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't authors set their own ad codes? =
Setting of the ad codes is limited to users that have the ability to save unfiltered html. This is available for the Editor role and up. This is a security measure since ads include script tags and prevents malicious code from being saved and then presented on the front-end of your site
